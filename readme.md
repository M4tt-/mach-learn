# mach-learn

Basic machine learning algorithms and problems. 

## Motivation

This repository was created to realize Coursera's 2018 Machine Learning Course offered by Stanford | Online and taught by Dr. Andrew Ng (completed June 2018 with a grade of 96.07% - certificate available upon request). It has expanded slightly to explore some independent, Python-based ML.

## Getting Started

Pull the master branch of this repository.

## Content

### MATLAB

The full content of the MATLAB-based machine learning course from Coursera is located in the `Coursera_ML` folder. Here, a collection of 8 exercises are organized into folders `Ex1`, `Ex2`, etc. Each contains a collection of `.m`'s and ocassioanlly some raw data in `.txt` files to accomplish some machine learning tasks. Here is a summary:

- **Ex1**: Linear Regression (cost function, feature normalization, gradient descent)
- **Ex2**: Logistic Regression and Regularization (more cost functions, sigmoid function)
- **Ex3**: Multiclass Classification and Neural Network Predictions (neural network units and weights, logistic regression)
- **Ex4**: Neural Networks and Back-Propagation (w/ and w/out regularization)
- **Ex5**: Regularized Linear/Polynomial Regression and Bias Variance
- **Ex6**: Support Vector Machines (Gaussian kernel, RBF kernel -- email processing application)
- **Ex7**: Principle Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering (centroids, projection -- image compression application)
- **Ex8**: Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering (movie rating application)

### Python

A brief exploration of the "Hello, World!" of machine learning: the iris flower data set (1936).
